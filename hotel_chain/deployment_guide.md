# Hotel Chain Data Model - Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Execute Scripts in Order
```sql
-- Step 1: Create schema and tables
@hotel_schema_ddl.sql

-- Step 2: Load base reference data  
@hotel_data_generation.sql

-- Step 3: Generate transaction data (15,000+ records)

UNION ALL SELECT 'Customers', COUNT(*) FROM CUSTOMERS  
UNION ALL SELECT 'Reservations', COUNT(*) FROM RESERVATIONS
UNION ALL SELECT 'Ancillary Sales', COUNT(*) FROM ANCILLARY_SALES
UNION ALL SELECT 'Revenue Summary', COUNT(*) FROM REVENUE_SUMMARY;

-- Verify data quality
SELECT

    MAX(CHECK_IN_DATE) as latest_checkin,
    COUNT(DISTINCT HOTEL_ID) as unique_hotels,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID) as unique_customers
