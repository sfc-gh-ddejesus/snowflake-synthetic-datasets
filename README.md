## üöÄ Quick Start with Snowflake

Each dataset is **Snowflake-ready** and includes:
- **Snowflake DDL**: Optimized database schemas for Snowflake Data Cloud
- **Semantic Views**: Business-friendly layers for Cortex Analyst
- **Data Generation**: Scripts using native Snowflake functions (GENERATOR, RANDOM, etc.)
- **Business Analytics**: Pre-built queries optimized for Snowflake SQL
- **Natural Language**: Ready for Cortex Analyst AI-powered analytics
- **Documentation**: Complete setup guides and Snowflake best practices

### Snowflake Setup
```sql
-- 1. Create schema and tables (Snowflake-optimized)
@hotel_schema_ddl.sql

-- 2. Generate realistic data using Snowflake functions
@hotel_data_generation.sql
@hotel_reservations_generation.sql

-- 3. Create semantic models via Snowflake UI
-- See SEMANTIC_MODELS_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions

-- 4. Start asking natural language questions!
-- "What is the revenue by hotel brand this year?"
-- "Show me occupancy rates by region and month"
```
